//    215. Kth Largest Element in an Array - Medium
//    Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.
//    Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

//    Example 1:
//    Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
//    Output: 5

//    Example 2:
//    Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
//    Output: 4

//    Constraints:
//    1 <= k <= nums.length <= 104
//    -104 <= nums[i] <= 104

//    Hi Everyone, last week, I had my virtual onsite with Facebook for the Sr Software Engineer (E5) position. I was asked following questions:
//
//    Phone Screen
//    Interviewer asked two coding questions. It was a 45 minute round.
//
//            1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III - Only node1 and node2 are given as input. Each node also has a pointer to its parent.
//1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors
//    My approach for answering Coding Questions:
//
//    Understand the problem. Ask clarifying questions.
//    Verbally explain the solution for the problem.
//    Also, provide the expected Time & Space complexity of the solution.
//    Once the interviewer is satisfied with the verbal solution, quickly implement it and then do a dry run with a few test cases covering corner cases.
//    Explain the Time & Space complexity of the written solution.
//    Virtual Onsite
//2 Coding Rounds (Ninja) + 1 System Design (Pirate) + 1 Behavioural Round (Jedi). Each round was of 45 minutes.
//
//    Coding Round 1:
//
//            953. Verifying an Alien Dictionary
//215. Kth Largest Element in an Array
//    System Design Round:
//    I was asked to Design Privacy Settings at Facebook. I spent around 40 mins on this question, and then in the remaining 5 mins, I asked questions to learn more about Facebook Culture.
//
//    Coding Round 2:
//
//            88. Merge Sorted Array
//426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List
//    Behaviour Round:
//    The interviewer started the round by asking about me. I described my current project and significant accomplishments. He then asked if I ever had to manage conflicting priorities. He also asked me if I ever received constructive feedback from a colleague. For each question, I provided a supporting anecdote from my experience and made sure my answers were in-line with Facebook's mission and core values. The interviewer also asked one Coding Question - 543. Diameter of Binary Tree.
//
//    Overall, it was a great experience. Two days after my virtual onsite, I got a call from the recruiter that the feedback from my interviewers is good, and they are still waiting for the hiring committee to make the final decision.
//
//    Best of luck everyone with your upcoming interviews :)
